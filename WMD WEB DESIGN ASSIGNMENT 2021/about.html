            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Paris is located in northern France, bisected by the Seine River. The city motto is 
                Fluctuat nec mergitur (‘[She] is tossed [by the waves], but does not sink’).
                 Historically, it makes reference to the ship that appears on the coat of arms and more generally,
                 to all the challenges the city has faced through its history.The colors of Paris are blue and red.
                 These are the same colors as the French flag, but without the white (white refers to the French monarchy)
                 Often nicknamed Ville Lumière (City of Light), it might refer to the city’s first gas lamps in the 19th 
                 century. Another theory is related to the Age of Enlightenment in France More locally, Paris is also 
                 nicknamed Paname about the Panama hats. This hat became very trendy in Paris at the beginning of the 20th
                century, and all the Parisian men used to wear it. In Paris, when you hear or read about Paname, they are 
                referring to Paris.Paris only has one sister city, and that’s Rome. Under the slogan, ‘Only Paris is worthy of Rome;
                only Rome is worthy of Paris.’, Paris and Rome were exclusively twinned in 1956.<br><br>France is part of Europe. 
                People living outside Europe like to divide the European continent into smaller geographical areas. Thus, Paris and

                (according to CNN travel). It was the 1st most visited city in Europe, now that London is not in Europe anymore.
