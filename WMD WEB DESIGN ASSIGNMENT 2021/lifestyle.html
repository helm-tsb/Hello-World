            <h2>Fashion In Paris</h2>
            <p>Paris is aiming to be the sustainable fashion capital of the world.The city of Paris has 
                announced official plans to become the most sustainable fashion capital by 2024. The 
                initiative, entitled 'Paris Good Fashion' will aim to push the fashion industry towards
                 using more sustainable practices, WWD reports."When I started out 
                in fashion 20 years ago, no one talked about sustainability," Lefort said. "But the world
                has changed: we are in a situation of ecological disaster. This is a huge concern for the 
                 younger generations, who are appealing to fashion brands to change their processes. We need
                 to create a dialogue between those two worlds."</p>

                Paris is a unique city which attracts millions of visitors every year, as well as numerous
                 expatriates who decide to make the city their home. With more than 136 museums, dozens of 
                 exhibitions, countless shows and a multitude of theatres, Paris is buzzing with life, and 
                 it is truly difficult to ever get bored in the city. Whether you are a history buff or an 
                 arts aficionado, Paris holds something for you which you will find nowhere else in the world.<br><br>
                 Paris has plenty of resturants and cafes for expats of all palates. As a culinary capital of 
                 thw world Paris is famed for its gourmrnt eatries. The City's many patisseriesalso prove also
                 prove that food as an art form is alive as well. The French are famous for their food, but 
                 those expates who've had their fill of croissants and creme brulee won't struggle to find 
                 restaurants offering international cuisinessuch as Chinese, Indian, Italian and Thai.<br><br>
                 With a culture as a serious about its leisure time as the French, its no wonder that Paris has 
                 plenty to offer for those looking to spend the day outdoors. The city's climate is highly seasonal
                 though, so the outdoor activities available oftendepend on the time of the day. Paris is home to a 
                 number of parks in which expats can enjoy leisurely strolls throughout the year. <b>Parc de la Villete</b>
                 is a particular favourite, as throughout the summer months a large screen is put in front of which 
                 anyone can relax and watch classic films. The selection usually includes English as well as French 
                 cinema, and a screening can be a great place to enjoy picnic. While open-air movies are'nt available
                 in Paris during the winter expats wanting to spend more time outdoors during frosty months, can instead
                enjoynumerous ice skating rinks around the city.</p>
